Daniel A. Ongchoco
Founding President & Managing Director
Boone, as he is more fondly called, once dreamed of playing professional basketball and winning the Philippines’ first Olympic gold medal. Today, however, he is better known as an innovation leader in the fields of education and information technology—breaking new grounds and barriers, and transforming lives along the way. In the field of education, he pioneered the first blended-learning international MBA program in the Philippines under the Gates Professional Schools umbrella—offering what he calls “the ultimate value for money MBA program.” He is also the founder of Gardner College, aptly called the “Global School of Innovation,” where he launched a first-of-its-kind holistic dual international degree program. Previously, he operated the largest mall-based I.T. school in the Philippines for 20 years under the Informatics brand name at the SM City North EDSA.
